PERSON (driver_id#: varchar(30), name: varchar(50),
address:varchar(100)
CAR (regno: varchar(20), model: varchar(30), Year:int)
ACCIDENT (report_number: int, accd_date: date, location:
varchar(50))
OWNS (driver_id#: varchar(30), regno: varchar(20))
PARTICIPATED (driver_id#: varchar(30), regno: varchar(20), report_number:
int, damage_amount: int)

1. select count(report_number)
from Accident
where extract(year from accd_date)=2008;

2. SELECT COUNT(report_number)
FROM car, participated
WHERE participated.regno = car.regno AND car.model = 'MD_01';

3. SELECT
  p.name AS OWNER_NAME,
  COUNT(DISTINCT a.report_number) AS "No. of Accidents",
  SUM(pa.damage_amount) AS "Total Damage Amount"
FROM
  person p
JOIN
  participated pa ON p.driver_id = pa.driver_id
JOIN
  accident a ON pa.report_number = a.report_number
GROUP BY
  p.name
ORDER BY
  "Total Damage Amount" DESC;

 INSERT INTO Accident (REPORT_NUMBER, ACCD_DATE, LOCATION)
   VALUES ('345', TO_DATE('2008-04-06', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 'Ludhiana');

4. SELECT
  p.name AS OWNER_NAME,
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM a.accd_date) AS ACCIDENT_YEAR,
  COUNT(DISTINCT a.report_number) AS "No. of Accidents"
FROM
  person p
JOIN
  participated pa ON p.driver_id = pa.driver_id
JOIN
  accident a ON pa.report_number = a.report_number
GROUP BY
  p.name, EXTRACT(YEAR FROM a.accd_date)
HAVING
  COUNT(DISTINCT a.report_number) > 2;


5. SELECT
  p.name AS OWNER_NAME
FROM
  person p
WHERE
  p.driver_id# NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT pa.driver_id# FROM participated pa);
